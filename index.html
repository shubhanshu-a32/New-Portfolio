        My name is Shubhanshu Upadhyay, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in 
        Computer Science and Engineering from Krishna Engineering College in Ghaziabad.
        Though I am a littble bit late but not last, I am trying my best to do in my field 
        of expertise.
        As of now, currently I am in last year of my B.Tech degree i.e., 4th year,
        but learning is the key to educate yourself this is the way I always move myself forward.
